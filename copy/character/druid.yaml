title: "Druid Python Dev"
description: "The hardware shaman convinced that every bug can be solved with \"a small hardware upgrade.\" His laptop looks like it came out of Mad Max. People are temporary, devices are forever. While everyone discusses software architectures, he has already built a working hardware prototype."
