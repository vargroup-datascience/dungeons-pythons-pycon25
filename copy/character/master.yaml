title: "Dungeon Master Python Dev"
description: "The orchestrator of chaos who masters all programming styles. Simultaneously handles rigorous unit tests and wild 2000-line scripts. Always has the solution that blends elegance, brutality, and black magic. While others debate the best design pattern, he has already deployed to production and is drinking a beer. Feared and revered in equal measure."
